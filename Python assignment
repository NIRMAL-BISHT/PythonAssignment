Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans - Python is called a general purpose language because it can be used in almost any thing like web dev,machine learning and even  in Big Data and it is high level language beacsuse it can easily be understood by human, it just like english ,we dont need to write binary language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans - Python is called dynamically typed language because we dont need to explicity specify the data type of the variable, it automatically assign the data type in run time depending on the value which is stored in thst variable.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans - Pros
1. It is high level programming language
2. It can be used in different fields like Ml,Web Dev, Big data.
3. It is easy to learn
Cons
1. It does not support abstraction
2. It is slow in compare to c++ as its code is interpreted in run time but in case of c++ the code is converted to binary at compile time.

1. Machine Learning.
2.Bg Data
3. Web Development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans - Variable is nothing but the name that we assign to a  memory location in which we are storing any value.
Declaration -   var_int = 4 # int
                var_bool = True # bool
                var_float = 3.4 # float
                var_string = "Hey There" # str

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans = the default type for the value that input function return is in form of str.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans - type cast is the way of converting one data type to another, for e.g
a = '45' # type str
a = int(a) # type int

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans = Yes we can take multiple input from single input function like
name,age = input("What is your name and age? :").split(" ") 
If we provide 2 input seperated by space than .split() will crete a list of two values and those value will unpack in name and age respectively.

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans - keywords are the reserved word that python uses to define something, these word have some meaning internally
For eg. - def,int,return

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans - No we can't use keywords as our variable name as those are reserved by python interpreter and they hold some meaning internally.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans - Operator in python are used to calculate something based on type of operator used.
Type of operator:
1. Logical operator -> and, or not 
2. Bitwise operator -> & |
3.Arithmetic operator -> +,%,-
4.Comparison operator -> >,<,>=,<=,==
5. Assignment operator -> =,+=,-=,*=

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans - / operator is used to do flaot division whereas // is used to do integer divison
For e.g - 3/2 = 1.5
          3//2 = 1

      else:
         print("Hey your number is an odd number") 

Q18. What are boolean operator?

      For e.g - 1>2 and 2>1 # This will evaluates to False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
1 or 0 - True
0 and 0 - False

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans - These are the statement which evaluates something based on some condition like (a>b),(a>=b)

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans - 'if' is use to do something when the condition of if satisfies and if the condition does not satisifies than we will execute elif block if 'elif' comdition satisfies and if not than we can execute 'else' block irrespective of any conditon.
for e.g
signalLight = "Red"
if signalLight=="Red":
  print("Stop")
elif signalLight=='Yellow':
  print("See")
 else:
  print("Cross the road")
  
  
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

else:
  print("You can't vote")
